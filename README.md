# Color Scheme Generator
This JavaScript app generates a color scheme based on a chosen color. The color is chosen using a color picker. The type of scheme can be selected from the following options:
- Monochrome
- Monochrome Dark
- Monochrome Light
- Analogic
- Complement
- Analogic Complement
- Triad
- Quad

The 6 resulting colors will be displayed. The Color API is what generates the colors, using an initial color and the mode. It returns the list of colors which are used to generate HTML and display them along with their hex codes.

This project uses JavaScript, HTML, CSS and The Color API.
